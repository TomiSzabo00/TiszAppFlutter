Hey brother, there’s an endless road to re-
discover.
Hey sister, know the water’s sweet but blood
is thicker.
Oh if the sky comes falling down, for you,
there’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do.
Hey brother, do you still believe in one
another?
Hey sister, do you still believe in love I
wonder?
Oh if the sky comes falling down, for you,
there’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do.

What if I’m far from home?
Oh brother I will hear you call.
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister I will help you out!
Oh if the sky comes falling down, for you,
there’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do.

Hey brother, there’s an endless road to re-
discover.
Hey sister, do you still believe in love I
wonder?
Oh if the sky comes falling down, for you,
there’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do.

What if...
