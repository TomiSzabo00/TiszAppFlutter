I heard
that you'll settle down
that you've found a girl
and you're married now
I heard
that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

old friend
why are you so shy
it ain't like you to hold back
or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I’d hoped you'd see my face and that you'd
be reminded
that for me it isn't over

Never mind
I’ll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
don't forget me
I beg
I remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead

you'd know
how the time flies
only yesterday
was the time of our lives
we were born and raised
in a summer haze
bound by the surprise
of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I’d hoped you'd see my face and that you'd
be reminded
that for me it isn't over yet

nothing compares
no worries, okays, regrets and mistakes
they're memories made
who would have known
how bittersweet this would taste
