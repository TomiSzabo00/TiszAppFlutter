I got my ticket for the long way run
Two bottle of whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I'm leaving tomorrow, what'dya say

When I'm gone
When I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my hair
You're gonna miss me everywhere, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

I got my ticket for the long way run
The one with the prettiest of views
It's got mountains, It's got river's
It's got sights to give you shivers
But it sure would be prettier with you

When I'm gone...
