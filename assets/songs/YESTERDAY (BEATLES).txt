Yesterday,
all my troubles seemed so far away,
now it looks as though they're
here to stay.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be,
there's a shadow hanging over me,
oh yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go I don't know,
she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to
play,
now I need a place to hide away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.
Why she had to go I don't know, she
wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to
play,
now I need a place to hide away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.
Mm mm mm mm mm.
