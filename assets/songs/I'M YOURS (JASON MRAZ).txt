Well, you done done me
and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill
but your so hot that i melted
I fell right through the cracks,
and i'm tryin to get back

before the cool done run out
i'll be givin it my best test
and nothin's gonna stop me
but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to
win some or learn some

I won't hesitate no more,
no more, it cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind
and see like me
open up your plans
and damn you're free
look into your heart
and you'll find love love love

listen to the music at the moment
maybe sing with me
Ah, la peaceful melody
It's your god forsaken right
to be loved loved loved loved Loved
