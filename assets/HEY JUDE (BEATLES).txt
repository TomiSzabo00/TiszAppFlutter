Hey Jude dont make it bad
take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
and then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude dont be afraid
you were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin
then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain hey jude
refrain
dont carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that its a fool who plays it
cool
by making his world a little colder

Da da da da da Da da      da   da

Hey Jude dont let me down
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into you heart
then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in hey Jude begin
your waiting for someone to perform with
And dont you know that its just you hey
jude you'll do
The movement you need is on your
shoulders

Da da da da da da da da         da

Hey Jude dont make it bad
take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
and then you'll begin to make it better

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na
Hey Jude (ismÃ©telve)
