# Contributors' Guide - How to contribute to this project
This guide was made to help others who would like to join the TiszApp crew and make changes to the app.

### Basic rules of the app:
- Always pay close attention to the fact that this app is not supposed to take over the experience in the camp.
- You should never implement any new features or changes without talking to others about it first.
- This project was always a charitiy work and it was never intended to be used as an income source.
- Design changes are always welcome, but keep in mind that the average age of the users is about 14.

### Steps of becoming a contributor
1. Talk to one of the current contributos about joining the team.
2. That's it! More help is always appreciated, so if you would like to help us, feel free to join. No prior experience is required, however you will have a much better time if you know what you are doing. :smile:

### How to contribute
If you joined the team and got access to the [repository](https://github.com/TomiSzabo00/TiszAppFlutter), **please read this section very carefully and adhere to all the rules here**.
This is important to keep this codebase **clean** and **easy to maintain**.

- Whenever you start working on a new feature or task, always create a new branch for it and work only there. Once you are done, you can open a pull request[^1] and - with or without a code review - it can be merged into `master`  - as
  - New branches should follow these conventions: `new-words-seprated-by-a-dash`. If it is connected to an issue, place the issue number in the front of the branch name followed by a dash. All words are lowercase

- After your work was merged, delete the source branch. You can always create a new one if more work needs to be done.

- We use [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel) architecture in this app. Please always try to follow the rules of the architecture, even if you have to create the simplest screen with one or two functions.

### That should cover the basics!
If you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact any of us. You already know how. :wink:
